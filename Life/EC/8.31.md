### Brief Introduction

Hello everyone, Very happy to be here again. I'm Humor.
I am a software developer.I come from Guilin.

It's been almost one year since I last joined Ray's EC.  
At that time, I just arrived in Shenzhen. I was in a start-up company.  
I didn't have friends except a few colleagues. I didn't have any social event.  
I usually went to work on weekends. After a long time , I felt tied. I want to meet some intersting people.
I decided to find some nice group.  So I found Ray's EC . 
At the beginning , I basically joined EC every Frinday. I was very happy even though my English was poor. 
I met many new friends.But good times do not last long.
Our company adjusted the hours. We stays late every evening. I can't join the Friday EC anymore. 

My life is not very good resently, so I want to join EC to get positive energy. Thank you a lot of familiar faces are still in EC.

I have a lot hobbies. such as sports\technology\magic\outdoor activity. If you go camping or climb mountain next time, you can invite me to join.
